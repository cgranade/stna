# 1x01: A Home Across the Stars #

Original airdate: 4 February 2018.

## Mission Briefing ##

Seven years ago, Starfleet initially observed the first use of warp by the Nyox, a previously unknown species.
Following first contact procedures, Listening Post 418 was dispatched to make observations until the Nyox were ready for first contact.
Unfortunately, this post was destroyed by the Dominion during the war.
Recently, however, the Nyox have begun to explore further and have sent a request for first contact.
Your mission is to rendezvous with the Nyox neowarp ship and represent the Federation during first contact.
